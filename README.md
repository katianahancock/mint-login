<h3>A project made during my time at Burlington Code Academy bootcamp (Cohort 0), to test my skills in replicating existing websites!</h3>
<p>I have since gone on to use these skills quite effectively, with an emergency replication of Purdue University's Group Performance Environments Research Lab (GROUPER) <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/GrouperLab">website</a>.</p>
